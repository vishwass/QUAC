# QUAC
Parallel Graph processing algorithm in Apache Spark (pySpark)to find the Maximal  Gamma Quasi cliques used for community detection in graphs of low to medium edge density .This project was designed using Map reduce framework for huge graphs.Because of the exponential complexity of the algorithm, we preferred a big data platform like Apache spark. The implementation has its application in social network to cluster similar profiles.Skills:-Python, Apache Spark(pySpark).
